						<h2>OptoSense: Towards Ubiquitous Self-Powered Ambient Light Sensing Surfaces</h2>
						<!-- <img src="resources/thumb-auburn.png" alt="" border="0" title="demo" > -->
						<p>
							OptoSense is a general-purpose self-powered sensing system which senses ambient light at the surface level of everyday objects to infer user activities and interactions. We present a design framework of ambient light sensing surfaces, enabling implicit activity sensing and explicit interactions in a wide range of use cases with varying sensing dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D), fields of view (wide, narrow), and perspectives (egocentric, allocentric), which supports applications ranging from object use and indoor traffic detection, to liquid sensing and multitouch input.

						<h2>Serpentine: A Reversibly Deformable Cord Sensor for Human Input (CHI 2018)</h2>
						<!-- <img src="resources/thumb-auburn.png" alt="" border="0" title="demo" > -->
						<p>
							Serpentine is a self-powered reversibly deformable cord capable of sensing a variety of human input such as pluck, twirl, stretch, pinch, wiggle, and twist. The sensor operates without external power source based on the principle of Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENG), and can be employed in wearable and playful interfaces.

Each book page is fabricated by a commodity 3D paper-based printer with interactive color 3D structures, then embedded with a variety of sensing and actuatione elements for storytelling, and finally are bound into a book as a standalone system requiring no additional digital devices.

						<!-- <img src="resources/thumb-auburn.png" alt="" border="0" title="demo" > -->
						<p>
							Whoosh is an interaction technique using non-voice acoustic input including blows, sip-and-puff, and directional air swipes to enable low-cost, hands-free, and rapid input on smartwatches. Inspired by the design of musical instruments, we also develop a 3D-printed custom watch case to introduce directional and bezel blows without additional electronics. With the variety of vocabulary, Whoosh enables real-time discreet microinteractions on smartwatch.

						<h2>Applying Design Studio Pedagogy in STEM Learning with Novel Presentation and Sensing Technologies (IEEE VR 2015)</h2>
						<!-- <img src="resources/thumb-auburn.png" alt="" border="0" title="demo" > -->
						<p>
							I worked in a team to develop projected augmented reality to add design studio learning models to a classroom for STEM classes that encourage creativity, innovation, and help build strong peer learning environments. Students do classwork using an enhanced version of Pythy, a web IDE for Python and Jython, that captures students' work and displays it around the room. We leverage the Microsoft RoomAlive Toolkit to construct a room-scale augmented reality using pairs of projectors and depth cameras. The system "pins" students' work to the walls, where teachers and students can view, interact with, and discuss.

						<h2>Master Project -- Quadcopter Navigation Using Google Glass and Brain-Computer Interface (2015)</h2>
						<p>
							I developed assistive technologies for ALS patients to explore surroundings with wearable technology and a camera-mounted quadcopter. Google Glass is used to creating telepresence by displaying drone-retrieved first-person view, and presenting visual stimili for Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP). OpenBCI, a mobile Brain-Computer Interface, acquires user's electroencephalogram (EEG) for real-time analysis. Thus, user's attention to different icons presented on Glass is used to navigate the quadcopter wirelessly. Java, Android Studio, and Matlab are used in the project.

						<h2>UIST 2014 -- FoodieBuddy: Smart Cooking Assistant (2014)</h2>
						<p>
							I led a team to develop a smart cooking assistant which allows users to look up recipes while cooking, without worrying about oily hands on touchscreen. With Kinoma Create, web-based speech and recipe APIs, microphones, speakers, and proximity sensors, we implemented voice commands, audio navigation, and in-air gestures for touchless interactions and smart recipe recommendation. Javascript and HTML are used to develop UI and interact with RESTful APIs.

						<h2>NASA Wearable Symposium 2014 -- Wearable Unobtrusive Noise Canceling Vest for ISS (2014)</h2>
						<p>
							I worked in a team to develop an unobtrusive wearable noise-canceling system for NASA astronauts onboard International Space Station (ISS) where very high level of noise is contantly generated from life support systems. Together we designed a vest with 3D printed adjustable collar integrated with circuit boards, speakers, microphones, and power supplies. I implemented  anti-noise generation in MAX/MSP, C, and Matlab for which could decrease various kinds of noise up to -10 dBA SPL.

						<h2>Dressage Horse Pattern Recognition (2014)</h2>
						<p>
							To help dressage riders analyze and review their performance, I developed approaches of wearable technologies, data analytics & visualization, and pattern recognition: Data are collected from sensors instrumented on rider and horse. Insights of the sport are revealed by signal processing and visualization techniques. Finally, a machine learning model is built to classify 10-class gaits with an overall accuracy of  97.4%. The development is done with Java, Android Studio, and Bluetooth Low Energy.

We developed an aritificial intelligence program called Drawing Apprentice, which collaborates with human users as they draw on a digital canvas. The user and the program take turns to draw strokes, where the program learns the style of the human user and adds its own creativity .
